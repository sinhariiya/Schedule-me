# Schedule-me
Schedule Me is a simple light android app to manage your day to day schedule.
In this application i have used Firebase as my backend database and for authentication management i have used Firebase Auth.



Things need to be implemented :

1. Curently a user can't change his/her password.
2. User can't edit his/her profile details like Name, email
3. Data is not cached locally so you can't see them without internet connection.

Feel free to contribute resolve possible bugs.
Thanks....
